## Image segmentation Using LinkNet
---

This repository contains a Tensorflow API version 2 implementation of the LinkNet architecture as proposed in [LinkNet: Exploiting Encoder Representations for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03718).

The dataset used in this project is The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LinkNet architecture in image segmentation tasks.
